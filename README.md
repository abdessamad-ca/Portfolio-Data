[Project -- Predicting Credit Card Approvals]()

Build a machine learning model that can predict if an individual's application for a credit card will be accepted. (Logistic Regression)
<br/>
<br/>
[Project -- Conversion Rate](https://github.com/abdessamad-ca/Portfolio-Data/tree/master/Conversion%20rate)

Build a model that will predict the conversion rate of customers on a website and make recommendations to our marketing team in order to increase our revenue. (Data visualization, Logistic Regression, Random Sampling, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet, Random Forest, SmoteTomek)<br/>
<br/>
[Project -- Fraudulent Activities](https://github.com/abdessamad-ca/Portfolio-Data/tree/master/Projet%20-%20FRAUDULENT%20ACTIVITIES)

Build a model that will predict whether the purchase of a piece of clothing should be considered a fraudulent transaction or not. (Machines Learning Models, Bokeh Map, Adaaboost, XGboost, Staking, Voting, PCA with SMOTETomel, Evaluation report)<br/>
<br/>

[Project -- Uber Pickups](https://github.com/abdessamad-ca/Portfolio-Data/tree/master/Projet%20UBER)<br/>

Give recommendations as to where drivers should be in order to maximize their chances of finding a race on schedule and build model to predict number of trips by hours. (K-means, DBSCAN, ARIMA, SARIMA)<br/>
<br/>

[Project -- SMS Spam (With Flask)]()<br/>

Create an application that will allow the user to enter an SMS into a form, read this message and predict whether this text is SPAM or not.(Flask)<br/>
<br/>

[Project -- Yelp Multi Label Classification]()

Build a model that will predict 9 labels purely (good_for_lunch, good_for_dinner, takes_reservations, outdoor_seating...) from the business photos uploaded by users. (Deep Learning, Transfer Learning, API kaggle)<br/>
<br/>

[Project -- Object Detection with YoloV3]()

The detection of objects in an image with Yolov3. (learn how to set up an environment and use a Github project)<br/>
<br/>

[Project -- Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets]()

The problem to be solved by this capstone project is how to identify which tweets are about ‘real disasters’ and which one’s aren’t. This project will use data science approach to build a machine learning classifier model to predict which tweets are about ‘real disasters’ and which one’s aren’t. (LSTM, NLP, Spacy, NLTK, Deep Learning)<br/>
